# Nomadic-Nest
# Nomadic-Nest Backend

Welcome to the backend of the *Nomadic-Nest* project—a travel recommendation system developed as part of a Software Engineering course. This backend is built using Node.js and Express.js, providing RESTful APIs to support the application's functionalities.

## 🗂 Project Structure

backend/
├── models/           # Defines Mongoose schemas and models
├── patterns/         # Contains design patterns or reusable logic
├── repositories/     # Handles data access and database operations
├── routes/           # Defines API endpoints and route handlers
├── services/         # Implements business logic and services
├── app.js            # Initializes the Express application
├── server.js         # Entry point to start the server
├── package.json      # Project metadata and dependencies
└── package-lock.json # Exact versions of installed dependencies

### Detailed Breakdown

- *models/*: Houses Mongoose schemas representing the application's data models, such as users, destinations, and bookings.

- *patterns/*: Contains reusable code patterns or utilities that promote DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles.

- *repositories/*: Encapsulates database operations, providing an abstraction layer over direct database interactions.

- *routes/*: Defines the application's API endpoints, mapping HTTP requests to controller functions.

- *services/*: Contains the core business logic, processing data and orchestrating operations between controllers and repositories.

- *app.js*: Sets up the Express application, including middleware configurations and route integrations.

- *server.js*: Starts the server, listening on the specified port and initializing the application.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v14 or higher)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) (local or cloud instance)

### Installation

1. *Clone the Repository*

   bash
   git clone https://github.com/m-monirr/Nomadic-Nest.git
   cd Nomadic-Nest/Nomadic-Nest-main/backend
   

2. *Install Dependencies*

   bash
   npm install
   

3. *Configure Environment Variables*

   Create a .env file in the backend/ directory and add the following:

   env
   PORT=3000
   MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/nomadic-nest
   

   Adjust the MONGODB_URI as per your MongoDB setup.

4. *Start the Server*

   bash
   npm start
   

   The server should now be running at http://localhost:3000.

## 📬 API Endpoints

The API endpoints are defined in the routes/ directory. Here's a brief overview:

- *User Routes*: /api/users
- *Destination Routes*: /api/destinations
- *Booking Routes*: /api/bookings

Each route file handles specific HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) corresponding to CRUD operations.

## 🧪 Testing

To run tests (if implemented):

bash
npm test


Ensure that your MongoDB instance is running before executing tests.

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- *Node.js*: JavaScript runtime environment
- *Express.js*: Web framework for Node.js
- *MongoDB*: NoSQL database
- *Mongoose*: ODM for MongoDB
- *dotenv*: Loads environment variables from .env file
